        <h2>Introduction to Web Design</h2>
        <p>Welcome to your first lesson in web design! This lesson covers essential concepts you need to build modern, accessible, and responsive web pages. We will focus on semantic HTML, responsive design, accessibility using ARIA, typography, and how mathematical principles like the golden ratio play a role in web design. Understanding these core principles will set you on the path to becoming a skilled web developer.</p>

        <p>Good web design is about more than just making something look nice. It's about creating a functional, user-friendly experience for all users, regardless of device or ability. This is where concepts like semantic HTML, responsive design, and accessibility come in.</p>

        <p>By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of how to structure your HTML correctly, make your pages accessible, and ensure they look good on both large and small screens using mathematical principles to create balance and harmony. Letâ€™s dive into the key topics!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- SEMANTIC HTML SECTION -->
      <section id="understanding-semantic-html">
        <h2>Understanding Semantic HTML</h2>
        <p>Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements for their intended purpose. This improves both the readability of the code and the accessibility of your website for users with disabilities. It also helps search engines better understand the structure of your content, which can improve SEO.</p>

        <h3>Why is Semantic HTML Important?</h3>
        <p>Using the right HTML elements for the right job not only makes your page more accessible but also more maintainable and future-proof. For example, instead of using a generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to mark up navigation, you should use a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag, which clearly indicates that this is a section for navigation.</p>

        <p>Some common semantic HTML elements include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code> - Represents the introductory section of a page.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> - Used for navigation links.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code> - Defines the main content area of a webpage.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> - Marks the bottom section of the page, often containing site info and links.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- ARIA AND ACCESSIBILITY SECTION -->
      <section id="aria-and-accessibility">
        <h2>ARIA and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is an essential part of web development. Everyone, including people with disabilities, should be able to access and use your website. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) helps enhance the accessibility of your site by making dynamic content and user interface components more accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers.</p>

        <h3>Common ARIA Roles and Attributes</h3>
        <p>ARIA adds special attributes to HTML elements, improving the experience for users who rely on assistive technologies. Here are some key ARIA roles you should know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>role="banner"</strong> â€“ Defines the header area of a webpage.</li>
          <li><strong>role="navigation"</strong> â€“ Indicates a navigation region.</li>
          <li><strong>role="main"</strong> â€“ Marks the primary content area of the page.</li>
          <li><strong>aria-label</strong> â€“ Adds a label for an element when there isn't a visible label.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using ARIA attributes correctly improves your site's usability for people with disabilities, and it's often a requirement for compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).</p>
      </section>

      <!-- RESPONSIVE DESIGN SECTION -->
      <section id="responsive-design">
        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>Responsive design ensures that your website looks great on all screen sizesâ€”from large desktop monitors to small mobile phones. Instead of creating separate sites for mobile and desktop, you create one site that adapts to different screen sizes.</p>

        <h3>How Does Responsive Design Work?</h3>
        <p>The core principle behind responsive design is using flexible layouts and media queries. Media queries allow you to apply different styles depending on the screen size.</p>

        <p>In this example, we're using Flexbox for the layout. On larger screens, the content is divided into two columns. However, when the screen size is smaller than 768px (such as on a phone), we change the layout to a single column.</p>

        <pre><code>@media (max-width: 768px) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column; /* Stack columns vertically */
  }
}</code></pre>

        <p>This media query detects when the screen width is less than 768px and then stacks the columns on top of each other. This ensures that your site is mobile-friendly, meaning it looks good and is easy to navigate on small screens.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices for Responsive Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use relative units like percentages, ems, or rems for widths and spacing instead of fixed pixel values.</li>
          <li>Design mobile-first by creating layouts for smaller screens first, then enhancing them for larger screens.</li>
          <li>Test your design on different screen sizes using browser tools or responsive design testing tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- MATHEMATICS IN WEB DEVELOPMENT SECTION -->
      <section id="mathematics-in-web-development">
        <h2>Mathematics in Web Development</h2>
        <p>Mathematics plays a crucial role in web design, particularly when it comes to layout, spacing, and typography. By using mathematical principles like the golden ratio, you can create visually appealing and well-balanced designs.</p>

        <h3>What is the Golden Ratio?</h3>
        <p>The golden ratio is a mathematical ratio commonly found in nature and art. It's approximately 1.618, and it has been used by artists, architects, and designers for centuries to create aesthetically pleasing compositions. In web design, the golden ratio can help create a harmonious relationship between elements like text and images.</p>

        <p>The formula for the golden ratio is often expressed as: <strong>A/B = (A+B)/A</strong>, which simplifies to approximately 1.618. This means that the larger part (A) is roughly 1.618 times the size of the smaller part (B).</p>

        <h3>Using the Golden Ratio in Layouts</h3>
        <p>In web design, you can use the golden ratio to define proportions between elements. For example, if you're designing a two-column layout, one column can be 65% of the width, and the other can be 35% (since 65/35 = 1.618).</p>

        <h3>Applying the Golden Ratio to Typography</h3>
        <p>Typography can also benefit from the golden ratio. You can scale font sizes proportionally by multiplying the base font size by the golden ratio (1.618). For example, if your base font size is 18px, the next level up (for a heading) would be 18px * 1.618 â‰ˆ 29px. This creates a natural hierarchy that is pleasing to the eye.</p>

        <h3>Other Mathematical Principles in Web Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> This principle divides a design into three equal parts horizontally and vertically, helping to place key elements along these lines or intersections for balance and focus.</li>
          <li><strong>Modular Scales:</strong> These are predetermined sets of values (often based on a ratio like 1.5 or the golden ratio) used to scale font sizes, spacing, or other elements in a harmonious way.</li>
          <li><strong>Grid Systems:</strong> Grids are used to organize content in a way that is both logical and aesthetically pleasing. Grids often follow a 12-column layout, allowing for flexible design options that still maintain structure.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- TYPOGRAPHY SECTION -->
      <section id="typography-basics">
        <h2>Typography Basics</h2>
        <p>Typography plays a critical role in web design. It affects how readable your content is and can influence the overall aesthetic of your site. Good typography helps users easily read and digest information.</p>

        <h3>1. Font Size</h3>
        <p>A base font size of 16px to 18px is generally recommended for body text. For headings, use a typographic scale where the font size increases as the heading level goes up (e.g., h1 is larger than h2).</p>

        <h3>2. Line Height</h3>
        <p>Line height controls the space between lines of text. A line height of 1.5 to 1.6 is considered ideal for readability. It gives enough space between lines to avoid overcrowding.</p>

        <h3>3. Font Choices</h3>
        <p>Stick to web-safe fonts like Arial, Verdana, or Georgia for maximum compatibility across devices. You can also use Google Fonts for more variety, but make sure the fonts you choose are easy to read, especially for longer texts.</p>
